Notes to self...

09 Jul 2014
  Where I left off:
  - I compiled the code (renamed mitgcmuv.hma), but cannot run it. I get a seg fault. I copied
    Xianming's mitgcmuv file from /mypfcrun/run/ and ran it. The run completed normally, but 
    it looks like it's throwing errors and just printing zeros. 

    Ask Xianming to sit down and get the code to run and to generate output identical to
    what he has so I can compare the two apples-to-apples and confirm I can reproduce his PFC
    results!
